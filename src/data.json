      "text": "During the early days of space exploration, both the United States and the Soviet Union faced a challenge of writing instruments in microgravity. While the Soviet Union opted for using pencils, NASA invested in developing a 'space pen' that could write in zero gravity, upside down, and even underwater. Eventually, both countries started using the space pen due to its reliability."
